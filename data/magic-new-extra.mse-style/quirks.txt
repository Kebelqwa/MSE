1.) There are no hybrid mana symbols w/ yellow in them.

2.) If you try to do an 8 color hybrid, you will get an error, but it causes no damage, and the template functions fine once you go back down to 7 colors.

3.) Although the hybrid box in the card color menu looks like its always choosable, you must choose atleast two colors to choose it.

4.) The P/T box color can be changed in the same way as card color.

5.) Non-default color choices in other templates will not carry over to this template when you change styles.

6.) You must have atleast previously had magic-new installed to use this template.

7.) Yellow, Orange, and Purple mana will not work in mana or cost keyword parameters.  The only way to fix it is to edit your game file and add "EPO" to the parameter match areas.

8.) Speaking of "E", E is yellow, P is purple, and O (no, not zero) is orange.

9.) Yellow, purple, and orange will sort as multicolor cards.

10.) Don't like my choices for yellow, purple, or orange?  Then you can replace the images with your own and it will still work.
